We aim to research current browser fingerprinting methods and determine the viability of developing a browser add-on to mitigate it.
Browser fingerprinting works by accumulating enough characteristics about a user's browser so that they can be uniquely identified when they return to a website, and can be used much like a HTTP cookie.
We describe in detail many of the characteristics used in a fingerprint, how they are retrieved, and possible methods for concealing the information from the fingerprinter.
We demonstrate that mitigating browser fingerprinting at the browser add-on level is difficult if not impossible without large sacrifices to usability on the majority of websites, and suggest what could be done in the future to try to mitigate fingerprinting.

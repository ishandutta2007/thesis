\chapter{Conclusion}

- does it help vs.\ fingerprinting?

- if so, how, if not, how not?

- what could have been done better (more specifically than just about everything)

- how can fingerprinting be prevented going forward (get browser developers more involved in protecting against it etc.)

future work

- would be interesting to examine fingerprinting from `the other side' i.e. try to fingerprint a large number of people

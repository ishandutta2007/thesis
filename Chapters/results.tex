\chapter{Results and Insights}

There were are some promising insights gained over the course of the project.
Table~\ref{tab:results} indicates the difference in how common certain browser characteristics are when Flash and Canvas Fingerprinting are available compared to when they are disabled.
A larger percentage indicates a more common value for a particular characteristic.
A Sony Vaio laptop with the OpenSuse Linux distribution was used for testing, running Firefox as the browser of choice.
The figures are calculated using \url{browserprint.info}, which provides how common each fingerprint characteristic is relative to all other users that have retrieved their fingerprint using the service.
The other techniques that were used were not immediately successful and either will not help to mitigate fingerprinting or require further research and development to improve.
This chapter will discuss the various parts of the browser that expose information, the methods used to try to restrict them and how successful they were.
